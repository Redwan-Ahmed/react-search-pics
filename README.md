# Image Search Engine - React 
👉[Demo](https://image-search-engine-react.herokuapp.com/)👈

## What is this project? 🤔
A simple project which allows users to search for images.

## What I learnt? 👏
1. Event Handlers - using inputs/forms to pass in a callback function using props. When the element (input/form) is called it will emit the event and trigger the callback function.
2. Arrow function syntax - makes sure we are calling the correct props during a callback event.
3. Rendering a list of images - learnt how to use a map function to render a list.
4. React Keys - using react keys on images to improve efficiency during rendering.
5. React Ref - learnt how to access single elements in the DOM and retrieve its data.
6. Axios - used axios.create() to send the GET request to the unsplash API. 
7. Bonus: Grid CSS system - loaded the images in a grid without any white space.
